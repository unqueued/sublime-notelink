# sublime-notelink

A Sublime 3 plugin to add Zettelkasten-like connections from one note to another. Based on @dansheffler's [MyWiki](https://github.com/dansheffler/MyWiki) and @Zettelkasten-Method's [sublime-notelink](https://github.com/Zettelkasten-Method/sublime-notelink).

## How to use package
Clone or download this project into Sublime's `Packages` folder and adjust the path to your notes folder in the `sublime-notelink.sublime-settings` file. Use the `ctrl+5` shortcut and reference a document of your choice. 
You can follow a link by simply pressing `ctrl+enter` while your cursor is inside the link you desire to follow.
I highly recomment reading [Dan Sheffler's account](http://dansheffler.com/blog/2015-05-11-my-zettelkasten-in-sublime/) on note taking using this Luhmann-inspired method as well as his other articles on his excellent [blog](http://dansheffler.com).

## Requirements
This package requires the the [Bracketeer](https://github.com/colinta/SublimeBracketeer) plugin.

## Change the shortcut
You can also modify the keyboard shortcuts in the `Default.sublime-keymap` file and tell sublime to automatically open after typing `[[`.
